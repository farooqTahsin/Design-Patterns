#  Head First Desgin Patterns
I provide comprehensive coverage of all the examples presented in "Head First Design Patterns", in addition to extra examples. 
Each of these examples is accompanied by UML diagrams to enhance clarity.

## 01-Strategy Pattern:
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
### Examples:
1. simuduck.
2. fight game.
3. payment processing system.

## 02-Observer Pattern:
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, 
all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
### Examples:
1. weather station.
2. numeral system.

## 03-Decorator Pattern:
The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
### Examples:
1. starbuzz.
2. starbuzz with sizes.
3. pizza store.

## 04-Factory Pattern:
1. The Factory Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
2. The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
### Examples:
* factory pattern :
    * pizza store
    * notification
* abstract factory pattern :
    * pizza store
    * car factory
