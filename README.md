#  Head First Desgin Patterns
I provide comprehensive coverage of all the examples presented in "Head First Design Patterns", in addition to extra examples. 
Each of these examples is accompanied by UML diagrams to enhance clarity.

## 01-Strategy Pattern:
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
### Examples:
1. simuduck.
2. fight game.
3. payment processing system.


## 02-Observer Pattern:
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, 
all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
### Examples:
1. weather station.
2. numeral system.
